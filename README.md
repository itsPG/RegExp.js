Known Issue
===========

Group result is broken.
(Is there a guide that tell me how to deal with the group of regular expression in JS?)

The algorithm I used in this project is not fast enough.
This is due to that I'm not sure if there's a way to figure out all match case in a single JS command.
I will fix it when I have free time.
